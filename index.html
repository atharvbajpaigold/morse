Each letter and number is represented by a sequence of dots (¬∑) and dashes (-), which were originally transmitted as short and long electrical pulses. It became widely used in maritime communication and military operations before the rise of radio, telephones, and the internet. Though mostly obsolete today, it‚Äôs still recognized internationally and used in emergency signaling.");
